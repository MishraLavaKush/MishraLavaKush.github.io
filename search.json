I have worked on multiple domain like Geospatial, Image Analytics, Aerospace, Insurance, Condition based monitoring, forecasting, NLP etc..\nData Science provides me an opporunity to explore mutiple domains and work with brillient minds accross the domains. Data Science is a changing our world exponetially and I am glad that I am also part of this journey.\nData Science is a vast field. it has it‚Äôs own life cycle and every data scientist follow this in any project. It‚Äôs very import for everyone to understand data science life cycle properly.\nThis page is a one stop shop where I will be sharing post related to data science stuffs, how to follow data science life cycle step by step, how to deploy a model and other important topics.\nStay Tuned!!\n\n\nClick here to check out my blog.\n\n\n   \n     \n     \n       Order By\n       Default\n         \n          Date - Oldest\n        \n         \n          Date - Newest\n        \n         \n          Title\n        \n         \n          Author\n        \n     \n  \n    \n      \n      \n    \n\n\n\n\n\nDate\n\n\nTitle\n\n\nAuthor\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeb 5, 2023\n\n\nDATA SCIENCE LIFE CYCLE ‚Äî AT A GLANCE\n\n\nLava Kush Mishra\n\n\n\n\nFeb 5, 2023\n\n\nDATA SCIENCE ‚Äî A NEW ERA\n\n\nLava Kush Mishra\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"

Understanding of Business Problem:\n\nPhoto by Jonathan Forage on Unsplash\n‚ÄúSuppose, Mohan started his adventurous journey with his friends and unfortunately he gets separated from his friends in the middle. Now, he is all alone in an unknown place. suddenly, he realizes that he doesn‚Äôt know his destination also because he did not discuss journey plan with his friends, he was just enjoying the route.‚Äù üòÆ\nNow, I hope you can better understand from the above example that it can happen in our project journey also if we don‚Äôt have proper understanding of our business problem and project roadmap.\nIt is required to have a good discussion with the stakeholders and top managements about business problem and their expectation from the team. To make this easy, we should have clear idea of below questions before deep dive into ant project.\n\nWhat is the business requirement?\nWhy do we need to do this?\nWhat is the expectation from the project?\nWhat are the business constraints involved in project?\nWhat is the acceptable margin?\nhow can we get the required data?\n\nThese are few examples. It can vary based on your project requiremets and expectations."

If we don‚Äôt have proper data and it‚Äôs understanding, it is very difficult to get meaningful insights out of it. we need to have proper discussions with domain experts about the route cause of the problem. We need to collect all data which can be a potential reason for the problem. If data is already available, it is good otherwise we need to talk to the respective teams to provide required data. It is very import to capture all possible scenario in our data sample.\nThere can be various types of data possible for a data science project. For example, if we are working on forecasting project, we will using time series data. If we are working on image analytics, we will be working on image dataset."

    "text": "5. Data Modeling:\n\nPhoto by Laura Ockel on Unsplash\nThis step is the core of the data science life cycle (DSLC). In this step, we transform our data into our desired form and use it for further applications. This step includes identification of proper method (selection of an appropriate techniques like classification, regression or clustering) and selection of data model. Once, model is selected, we need to focus on hyper parameters tuning which is directly related to model performance. Optimization of hyper parameters help to achieve best possible performance of the model. Model evaluation is also an integral part of model performance optimization. Model evaluation metrics (mse, mspe, log-loss, ROC-AUC curve etc..) should be selected in such a way so that it can calculate errors after each steps which should be handled by model optimizer."

We need to transform our model output in desired format so that it can fulfil business requirement."
